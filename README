## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive data visualization analysis of forest fire incidents in Turkey over the last two decades. By integrating satellite data with official government reports, the study aims to reveal spatial clusters, temporal trends, and the primary drivers of wildfires.

The analysis highlights the dual character of fires in Turkey: **climate-driven forest fires** in coastal regions and **human-induced agricultural burning** in the southeast.

**Key Objectives:**
* To visualize the **spatial distribution** of fire incidents across 81 provinces.
* To identify **seasonal patterns** and peak fire periods.
* To analyze **annual trends** and anomalies (e.g., the 2021 mega-fires).
* To examine **primary causes** (human negligence vs. natural).
* To evaluate post-fire **rehabilitation strategies** (Afforestation vs. Maintenance).

## Key Findings & Visualizations

### 1. Spatial Distribution (Where?)
> **Insight:** Fires are highly concentrated in the **Mediterranean and Aegean coastal zones** (Forest Fires) and **Southeastern Anatolia** (Agricultural Stubble Burning).

### 2. Seasonal Analysis (When?)
> **Insight:** There is a strict seasonal cycle. Fire activity rises in June and reaches its **absolute peak in August and September**.
![Monthly](Plots/Monthly.png)

### 3. Annual Trend (Trends & Anomalies)
> **Insight:** While **2009** had the highest frequency of fire counts (mostly agricultural), **2021** stands out as a catastrophic climate-driven anomaly ("Mega-fires").

### 4. Primary Causes (Why?)
> **Insight:** **Negligence (45%)** is the leading cause of forest fires, far exceeding natural causes like lightning. This indicates that most fires are preventable.

### 5. Rehabilitation Efforts (Recovery)
> **Insight:** Recent data (2020-2024) shows a strategic shift in rehabilitation efforts towards the **maintenance** of existing forests rather than new afforestation.
