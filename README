## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed forest fire incidents in Turkey using **NASA FIRMS satellite data (2000-2021)** and examined the primary causes and rehabilitation efforts based on **OGM Activity Reports (2020-2024)**. 

The main objectives are:
1. To visualize the **spatial distribution** of fires across provinces.
2. To understand **seasonal and annual trends**.
3. To evaluate **post-fire recovery strategies** (Afforestation vs. Maintenance).

## 📊 Key Visualizations & Analysis

### 1. Spatial Distribution (Map)
This map visualizes the cumulative density of fire points over 21 years.
![Map](Plots/Map.png)
> **Insight:** > * **Coastal Zones (Extreme):** Antalya, Muğla, and İzmir show high activity due to the hot Mediterranean climate.
> * **Southeastern Anatolia:** High activity in Adana and Şanlıurfa is attributed to **agricultural stubble burning** (anız yakma), which satellites detect as thermal anomalies.

### 2. Seasonal Analysis
Monthly distribution of fire incidents aggregated over 21 years.
![Monthly](Plots/Monthly.png)
> **Insight:** There is a strict seasonal cycle. Fire activity rises sharply in June and reaches its **absolute peak in August and September**.

### 3. Annual Trend
Yearly evolution of fire frequencies (2001-2021).
![Yearly](Plots/Yearly.png)
> **Insight:** > * **2009:** Highest frequency in count, likely due to agricultural practices.
> * **2021:** A catastrophic "mega-fire" year driven by extreme weather. Although the count was lower than 2009, the ecological destruction was massive.

### 4. Primary Causes
Breakdown of fire causes based on OGM data.
![Causes](Plots/Lollipop.png)
> **Insight:** **Negligence (45%)** is the leading cause of forest fires, far exceeding natural causes like lightning (10%).

### 5. Rehabilitation Efforts
Post-fire recovery data (2020-2024).
![Rehab](Plots/Afforestation.png)
> **Insight:** Rehabilitation efforts focus heavily on the **maintenance** of existing forests rather than new planting. Total rehabilitation volume shows a declining trend since 2020.
